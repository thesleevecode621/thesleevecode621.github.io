every method will always return object  
for instance 

if you do

def say_hello

puts "say hello"

end 

the return value will be nill  because it only printing to console  and  every method needs to retun object on this case this  is nill 

2 
arr = ["max","red"]

def ary_each(arr)
arr.each do |v|

end  
end 

 ary_each(arr)
 in the case the method  the returning object it going to return will be the orginal  array since each returns the orginal
 array 
 and array is an object
 if you use a method  find 
 it will return the altered object 
 this case it will be the new array with the returning values it matched
 
 same with if staments  with if and else  stament you explicitly dictating value you want the method to return
