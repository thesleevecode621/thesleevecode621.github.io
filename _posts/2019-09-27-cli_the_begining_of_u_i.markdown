cli is like the bare bones of an app

in app you are gonna build you are  you gonna need 

3 things 


first thing it needs to do prompt the user(uber showing your location,selecting a fare)

second thing it needs to do is take input from the user(uber putting  your location)

third return  user  object he requested (uber sending driver,same way vice versa)
cli project i fill like it is teaching  you how theese object interact with each other 
and how to retrive info from a db or in this case a website what you scraped
