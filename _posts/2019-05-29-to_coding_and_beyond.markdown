My whole life  I've wondered,

what it would be like to create something. 

Something, that would be usefull!


Something to help others solve a  problem

May it be a search query or a way to help peope store info,

Or even a way to help pepole to connect. 


With coding I hope to obtain this dream.  

I hope to help people get what they need.


I also learned alot since starting this bootcamp program.

What I have learned so far is the following, 

1. To be humble! To never think you know it all, and  when your stuck reach out  for help 
2. Going through the process  with test driven developement, is a very important componet to being a good developer. 
3. Understanding the key to success, is by  helping other people succeed. 
4. Faliure plays a critical part to your success, because when you fail,  you figure out the bugs, thats when you learn the most.
5. There is always another solution to the problem.  No matter how much you think you know, you will always be surprised


In clossing I hope to learn and understand more in the coming weeks!!
