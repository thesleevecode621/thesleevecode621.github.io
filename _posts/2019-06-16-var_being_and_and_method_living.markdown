I look at veribale as setting itself to being what it is only 
assign to be I
It only does what it was assign to do
Like a container, what ever you put in it will hold 
It holds value  
The meaning of being 

I look at methods as things that could 
Alter just being and give the being some 
Life some attr personality for instance, 
you have a blank paper.
First you need an idea, method of what you want to draw
you then need to draw  the method.
You need method for people to see your draw 
now each blank paper is altered by these methods
